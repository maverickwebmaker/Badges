<title>Criteria for Maverick Webmaker self-issued badge</title>
</head>
<body>
Created a self-issued badge using the <a href="http://badgelab.herokuapp.com/">Badge Lab Tutorial</a>. In addition to the listed requirements of that tutorial, the earners of the ottonomy.net self-issued badge must also use a hashed email address and self-host all the related files instead of using the badgelab app.
